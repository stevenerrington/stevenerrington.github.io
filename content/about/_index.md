## About me

Hello! I'm Steven - I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Monosov Lab](https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/ilya-monosov-phd/) at Washington University School of Medicine. 


##### Academic background

I started my studies in 2010 at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/psychology/) in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where I got my BSc (Hons) in Psychology in 2013. 

During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to explore areas of research I got interested in. I got my first start in neuroscience research working in [Prof Jenny Read's lab](https://www.jennyreadresearch.com/) at Newcastle University. Here I got to learn more about how to run visual psychophysics experiments in humans and insects, aiming to understanding how visual information across the eyes is merged to form one cohesive image. I also spent time as a research intern at the Institue of Health and Society (now the [Population Health Sciences Institute](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/population-health/)) at Newcastle University, where I studied socioeconomic factors related to the incidence of childhood cancers in the North of England. During the summer of 2012, I joined the [Psychopharmacology and Emotion Research Lab](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/research/psychopharmacology-and-emotion-research-laboratory) at the University of Oxford, funded by a [Wellcome Trust Biomedical Vacation Scholarship](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/biomedical-vacation-scholarships). Here, I studied the effects of prebiotics on emotional processing and stress responses.

After graduating from Northumbria, I went on to get my Master's degree in Neuroscience (MRes) from Newcastle University. As part of my Master's research, I joined the [Lewy Body Lab](https://www.lewybodylab.org/home) working with Prof John-Paul Taylor and Dr Greg Elder to understand the relationship between visual hallucinations, visuo-perceptual function, and attention in Lewy Body Dementia. I continued with this work beyond my MRes, before joining the [Delicato Lab](http://delicato.org/Delicato/Research.html) as a research assistant; here, we looked at emotional processing abilities in patients with Parkinson's disease.


After several(...) years of applications, I was accepted into a PhD Psychology program at Vanderbilt University.

Finally, after finishing my PhD, I joined the Monosov lab at Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis.


##### Personal background
I was born and raised in Newcastle-upon-Tyne - a city in the United Kingdom. I lived here until July 2017, then I moved to Nashville, TN to start my PhD.
