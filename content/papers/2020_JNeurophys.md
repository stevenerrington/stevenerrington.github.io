##### Abstract

Express saccades are unusually short latency, visually guided saccadic eye movements. They are most commonly observed when the fixation spot disappears at a consistent, short interval before a target spot appears at a repeated location. The saccade countermanding task includes no fixation-target gap, variable target presentation times, and the requirement to withhold saccades on some trials. These testing conditions should discourage production of express saccades. However, two macaque monkeys performing the saccade countermanding task produced consistent, multimodal distributions of saccadic latencies. These distributions consisted of a longer mode extending from 200 ms to as much as 600 ms after target presentation and another consistently less than 100 ms after target presentation. Simulations revealed that, by varying express saccade production, monkeys could earn more reward. If express saccades were not rewarded, they were rarely produced. The distinct mechanisms producing express and longer saccade latencies were revealed further by the influence of regularities in the duration of the fixation interval preceding target presentation on saccade latency. Temporal expectancy systematically affected the latencies of regular but not of express saccades. This study highlights that cognitive control can integrate information across trials and strategically elicit intermittent very short latency saccades to acquire more reward.
