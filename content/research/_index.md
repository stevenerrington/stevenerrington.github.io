## Research areas
We possess the ability to learn from our environment and utilize the information we gather to guide our actions. This process involves various cognitive and neural mechanisms that facilitate our understanding of the world and enable us to interact with it effectively.


I joined the Monosov Lab for my postdoc role in January 2023 to investigate the cortical and subcortical systems that control exploration and learning.

#### Timing in the basal forebrain
 Whilst exploring our environment, we need to learn what aspects of our behaviour lead to success, selecting them over other options that may be detrimental to performance. However, our environment is rarely stable and actions that may be useful in one context may not be useful in another. As such, in new or unfamiliar environments, we have a greater uncertainty as to which choices will lead to positive or negative outcomes. Accordingly, our behaviour needs to be flexible so that we can explore and interact with these new environments, building up a representation of its structure, learning the relationship between stimuli, actions, and outcomes.
